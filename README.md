# Authentication & Error Handling

The Fitness Market employs a secure and user-friendly authentication system powered by Django Allauth, ensuring that user registration, login, and subscription payments are safe and smooth. Additionally, real-time error handling is integrated into the platform, providing clear feedback to users when issues arise during registration, login, or payment processes.

## Authentication:


### Form Error Handling:

#### User Registration & Login:

If a user enters invalid or missing information (such as incorrect credentials or empty fields), clear and real-time error messages will appear on the registration/login form. For example, if a required field is left blank or a password doesn’t meet the required criteria, the form will highlight the error and provide guidance on how to resolve it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d4c830b-b45f-42d4-823f-dca66d1569ad)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fb10d38-122e-4dba-a8c5-72df7177f7d5)

Users are also informed of succcesful logins and logouts.

These error messages are displayed directly above or below the relevant form fields, ensuring users can quickly identify and correct their input.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00d2f25-2573-4128-8b6b-f87a7e341b03)



## Stripe Card Handler Errors:

### Payment Processing:

When users enter their payment details during the subscription checkout process, Stripe is used as the payment gateway to process card transactions securely.

### Real-Time Error Handling: 

If there’s an issue with the card (e.g., expired card, insufficient funds, or incorrect card number), Stripe will return a specific error message that will be displayed immediately on the checkout page.
Users will be notified with a clear error message (such as "Card declined," "Insufficient funds," or "Invalid card details"), allowing them to quickly correct the issue and try again.
These error messages are designed to be helpful and user-friendly, guiding users toward resolving payment issues without frustration.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f014f83-4b48-4084-a39b-5841673afa8b)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdd43664-9894-433f-8088-1b29132037a7)

## Design Overview:

### Minimalistic Design: 

The design prioritizes simplicity and clarity. We have kept the interface clean with a minimalistic approach, ensuring that users are not overwhelmed by too many elements at once. Every component is carefully placed to create a visually appealing and functional layout.

### User-Friendly Interface: 

The website is built with user experience in mind. Key features, such as adding products to the shopping bag, checking out, or subscribing to plans, are easily accessible and clearly laid out. The goal is to minimize the number of steps it takes for users to complete tasks.

### Fixed Navigation:

Persistent Navigation: The website features a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page that remains visible as users scroll. This ensures that essential options (like the shopping bag, account login, and navigation links) are always within easy reach.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b69caf25-e4c0-464c-b641-7f0d3bfc1c8f)

### Smooth Transitions: 

Actions like adding products to the bag, navigating through categories, or switching between pages are accompanied by smooth transitions, improving the overall experience.

### Responsive Design:

Mobile and Tablet-Friendly: The Fitness Market is fully responsive, meaning the layout automatically adjusts for optimal viewing on devices of all sizes, including smartphones and tablets. Users can browse, shop, and manage subscriptions without any issues, regardless of the device they're using.

### Adaptive Images:

Images, such as product pictures, are dynamically resized to ensure they display correctly on all screen sizes without compromising load times or image quality.

## Manual Testing

In addition to automated tests, The Fitness Market underwent thorough manual testing to ensure all features function as expected across different scenarios. Below is a table outlining the key checks performed during manual testing.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69f0003e-fc25-4593-9217-77afcaa72ef1)

### Performance Testing

The website unfortunetely fails at times with the light house performace . At times it is all above 90 but at other times it can be like below. The indicators of what needs to be chnged is well outside my scope . After extensive research in minimize threadwork and reducing unused CSS and JS without breaking my code I could not get the lighthouse score consistent albeit at times it seems to work fine.One change i did make that vastly improved performance was reducing the background image size. Decision was made to submit as is due to time constraints and knowledge on how to further improve the lighthouse score.

## CSS Validator 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89208bf4-0a0a-4fcd-adac-554f7ebd36d7)

All CSS files passed validator requirements.

HTML Validator was used but errors are shown but more for the reasons of not liking the tag elements included.

#### Current Status: 

While most screens are properly styled and the site is responsive, occasional layout issues may arise on particular devices. These are minor and do not significantly affect the overall user experience, but ongoing design tweaks are planned to address them.

### Overall Impact:

Despite these issues, the website is fully functional on all screen sizes and provides a smooth experience for users. The core features, such as subscription management, shopping, and checkout, all work as expected, and these issues will be addressed in future updates to improve the site’s performance and usability.

## Future Plans

The Fitness Market is continuously evolving to better serve its users and provide even more value. Here are some of the exciting features and improvements planned for the future:

### 1. Expanded Subscription Options:

Run Clubs & Tailored Workout Plans: We plan to introduce run clubs and more tailored workout plans to cater to users with specific fitness goals, such as runners, bodybuilders, or general fitness enthusiasts. This will provide even more variety and personalization to the subscription offerings.

### Customized Meal Plans: 

In addition to general meal plans, we aim to create more specific meal plans tailored to individual dietary preferences, such as keto, vegan, or gluten-free, ensuring all users find a plan that fits their needs.

### 2. User-Generated Product Uploads:

#### Super Users: 
We are working towards allowing super users or trusted community members to add products directly to the website without needing admin access. This will streamline the process of adding new products and offer a wider range of items to choose from.

### 3. Video Content:

#### Free and Paid Video Content:

A major future addition is the introduction of video content on the platform. This will include both free videos (e.g., introductory fitness tutorials, beginner workouts, etc.) and paid content (e.g., premium workout guides, expert fitness tips).

#### Enticing Users to Subscribe:
We plan to offer free initial videos to entice users to sign up for specific plans. This can serve as an engaging way to demonstrate the value of the subscription services and encourage conversions.
These updates are aimed at making Gymstitute even more personalized, engaging, and accessible for all users. The goal is to expand the platform's offerings while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Marketing

To increase visibility and engagement, Gymstitute has implemented a focused marketing strategy using Facebook to reach and connect with potential customers. This approach aims to build brand awareness, drive traffic to the website, and boost conversions.

### Established Social Presence: 

The Fitness Market has a dedicated Facebook business page that serves as a hub for updates, promotions, and community engagement.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad8b2795-ca58-40fe-bee5-0188fae6f32a)



### Product Launch Events: 

We regularly create and post events for product launches and special promotions. These events are designed to generate excitement, encourage attendance, and provide information about new offerings.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fea43bab-2fbd-45ea-ac34-2917373ff704)


### Direct Links to Website:

Posts on our Facebook page include direct links to product pages on the website, making it easy for users to explore and purchase products directly from the platform. This seamless connection from social media to the website aims to improve user engagement and increase conversions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e225dfac-6216-4182-8088-b23d31f9eb37)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f16f78-1d8d-429c-be89-9dfbac5f7a02)


By leveraging Facebook, The Fitness Market can reach a wider audience and keep users informed about the latest products, events, and updates. This marketing strategy is a key component of our efforts to build an active and engaged community around the Gymstitute brand.

#### Please be advsied the links on the website will not redirect to the Facebook page as per instruction from the course. The page may get deleted by the time of review so the facebook links will just open up the facebook login page.

## Databases and Cloud Hosting

PostgreSQL Database
The Fitness Market uses a PostgreSQL database to store essential data, such as user information, product details, order history, and subscription information. PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness, scalability, and compatibility with Django, providing a reliable relational database that supports the platform's core functionalities. This setup ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, allowing for seamless interactions across the website.


### AWS Cloud Services for Static and Media Files

To manage static assets and media files efficiently, AWS Cloud Services was implemented, providing a secure and scalable solution for hosting The Fitness Market’s files.

### S3 Bucket for Storage: 

An AWS S3 bucket was created specifically to host the website’s static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) and media files (e.g., product images, user-uploaded images). This setup reduces the load on the main server, ensuring faster load times and a smoother user experience.

#### Security Policies and Permissions:

#### Policies: 
A custom bucket policy was applied to control access, ensuring files are accessible by the website while remaining secure from unauthorized access.
Amazon Resource Name (ARN): An ARN was generated and attached to the policy to establish clear permissions, providing the necessary access rights for the platform to retrieve and display static and media files seamlessly.
Using AWS S3 for static and media file hosting allows The Fitness Market to handle larger volumes of data efficiently, optimize load speeds, and provide a scalable solution as the platform grows.

## Agile Development

The Fitness Market was developed using an Agile methodology to ensure a flexible, iterative approach to building and refining the platform. This approach allowed for continuous improvement and adaptation based on project requirements and user feedback.

### Kanban Board

#### Task Management:

A Kanban board was used to track progress and manage tasks throughout the development process. Tasks were organized into columns such as “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done,” providing a clear, visual representation of the project’s status at any time.

#### Workflow Transparency: 

The Kanban board helped streamline the workflow, allowing team members and stakeholders to monitor progress, prioritize tasks, and address any bottlenecks quickly and efficiently.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
To prioritize tasks and features effectively, the MoSCoW method was applied. This helped ensure that the most critical elements of Gymstitute were developed and delivered on time, while also keeping flexibility for future enhancements.

#### Must-Have: 

Core functionalities such as user registration, product browsing, shopping bag functionality, and the checkout process were identified as Must-Have tasks, critical to the platform’s operation.

## Deployment to Heroku

The Fitness Market has been successfully deployed to Heroku to leverage its robust hosting capabilities for Django applications. Here’s an overview of the deployment process and configurations:

### App Creation: 

I created a Heroku app specifically for The Fitness Market, choosing an appropriate region to optimize performance for my target audience.

### GitHub Integration:

The Heroku app was linked directly to the The Fitness Market GitHub repository, enabling seamless deployment. This integration allows for continuous deployment, ensuring that any updates made to the main branch in GitHub are automatically reflected in the live application.

### Configuration Variables:

Essential configuration variables were added to the Heroku app’s settings to support AWS S3, Stripe, and PostgreSQL. These included:

AWS S3 credentials for static and media file storage, including AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME.
Stripe API keys for secure payment processing, including STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, and STRIPE_WH_SECRET (webhook secret).
DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL database access, allowing Gymstitute to store and retrieve data reliably.
SECRET_KEY for Django application security, ensuring encrypted sessions and secure data handling.

### Database Setup: 

A PostgreSQL database was provisioned through Heroku’s add-on marketplace, and Heroku generated the DATABASE_URL configuration variable automatically. This database supports all core functionalities of the platform, such as user accounts, product data, and order histories.

#### Static and Media File Storage: 

Static assets and media files were hosted using AWS S3 to enhance load times and reduce the server load. This setup was configured with a custom bucket policy and access permissions using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), allowing Heroku to retrieve and serve these files seamlessly.

#### Deployment and Testing:

After configuration, the app was deployed to Heroku, with migrations and static file collections executed to finalize setup. The platform was tested in its production environment to ensure all core functionalities, including checkout, subscriptions, and image displays, were working as expected.

Through Heroku's reliable hosting, continuous deployment from GitHub, and integration with PostgreSQL and AWS S3, Gymstitute is now set up to provide users with a seamless, responsive experience in a scalable production environment.
